# RISCV-ISA_Project
This project is about designing and implementing a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture based on the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) using HDL (Hardware Descriptive Language). Specifically, the project focuses on the RV32I subset, which is a 32-bit integer instruction set.
